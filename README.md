# Rock Paper Scissors
This Rock Paper Scissors app is a project I completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) curriculum. The purpose of this project was to practice my JavaScript DOM manipulation skills by building an interactive browser game.
